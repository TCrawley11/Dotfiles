# Dotfiles for Kitty, nvim, and fish shell
---

Included within this repo are my dotfiles for my current arch configuration.
These are the three utilities I use the most, and have dotfiles I find necessary.
Other tools' dotfiles will be added in the future as I see fit while transferring setups between machines.
